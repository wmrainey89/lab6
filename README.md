### Instructions

Using Javascript to calculate time and dates is pretty simple with its [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). The thing is, it doesn't format the date. For example:
		~~~~~~
		Date.now() //returns 1436375033726
		~~~~~~
This is a decent format if doing computations; but if intended for display, it should be readable by an average consumer. This project will format the return values of the Date object.

### Further Reading
Using [Regular Expressions(or Regex)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) could assist with manipulating values. Test out any regex with a [tester](https://regex101.com/).

### Basic Req's

The functions have been scaffolded out. In most instances - only the happenTemplate.js file will need to be implemented. Look over the index.html file to understand how the happen function will be executed. Implement each function to make the tests pass. Reference the tests as a guide to what each function should do. Please refrain from altering the tests.


### Extra Credit
Extend happen to work with multiple inputs.
